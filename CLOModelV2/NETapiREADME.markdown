This project integrates a .Net interface for the cash flow modelling tool for CLOs.

## Dependencies
The project is based on the [Qt Libraries](http://qt-project.org/) version 5.3 and the [.Net famework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279).

In addition to those base libraries it makes use of:

- [The Bloomberg Api v3](http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/) (A Bloomberg login is required only if you wish to use Bloomberg functionalities)
- [QuaZIP](http://quazip.sourceforge.net/) and [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) to manage compressed files
- [KDChart](http://www.kdab.com/kdab-products/kd-chart/) for the chart widgets
